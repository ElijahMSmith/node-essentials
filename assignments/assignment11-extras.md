# **Assignment 11 — Final Project**

## **Assignment Instructions**

Your assignment is to complete the final project and to prepare your final presentation.  If you have completed all assignments through assignment 10, you have completed a final project, except that we'd like you to do something extra if time permits.  The lesson contains some ideas for what you could do, or you may come up with a different idea.  You should only make changes to the back end, so that you are not distracted by React code.

Make your changes to an assignment11 branch of your node-homework repository.  Do a complete test. If you are adding or modifying APIs, test them.  If you are enabling Swagger, make sure that you can see the Swagger user interface.

**Important** We hope that you do add some extra function.  If you do add extra function, describe what you added in the file project-summary.txt.  In particular, if you add or modify any REST APIs, document the new or modified APIS, with enough information that your reviewer can try them out: the path, the method, the query parameters if any, and the body if any.

## **Submit Your Assignment on GitHub**

📌 **Follow these steps to submit your work:**

#### **1️⃣ Add, Commit, and Push Your Changes**

- Within your node-homework folder, do a git add and a git commit for the files you have created, so that they are added to the `assignment11` branch.
- Push that branch to GitHub.

#### **2️⃣ Create a Pull Request**

- Log on to your GitHub account.
- Open your `node-homework` repository.
- Select your `assignment11` branch. It should be one or several commits ahead of your main branch.
- Create a pull request. **Save the link to this pull request.**
- **Merge the pull request.**  In this one case, you do not wait for your reviewer.
- **On Render.com, open the dashboard for your service and do a manual deploy of the main branch.**
- **Test that everything works for your Render service, including any extra function you have added.**


#### **3️⃣ Submit Your GitHub Link**

- Paste the URL of your pull request into the **assignment submission form**.  Your reviewer may look at the changes for the pull request or perhaps the entire main branch.
